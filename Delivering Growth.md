# Delivery Cost Optimization – Case Competition Project
Project Summary & Business Objective
In this case competition, our goal was to analyze delivery cost data and uncover actionable insights to support cost optimization and operational efficiency. The primary business problem centered around high variability in delivery expenses across product types, business segments, and volume ranges. Our objective was to develop data-driven recommendations that would reduce delivery costs while maintaining service levels.

# Group’s Solution
Our team cleaned and explored the dataset using EDA techniques to uncover key patterns, including cost discrepancies across ZIP codes and product categories. We then applied predictive modeling approaches—such as ARIMA for forecasting and XGBoost for classification—to estimate future delivery trends and pinpoint cost drivers. We visualized these results in an interactive map showing sales distribution by ZIP code, enabling targeted cost-saving strategies.

### Key deliverables:

Cleaned dataset (excluded from repo per policy)

ARIMA forecasts of delivery trends

XGBoost models for cost prediction

Interactive map of sales by ZIP code

Business recommendations for optimization

# My Individual Contribution
### As part of this project, I focused on:

Cleaning and preprocessing the raw delivery data

Conducting in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify key drivers of cost

Implementing XGBoost to model cost prediction and validate results with cross-validation

Building an interactive sales map by ZIP code to visually support our findings

Presenting our key takeaways and business recommendations in a clear and engaging format

# Business Value of Our Solution
### Our analysis empowers stakeholders to:

Identify ZIP codes and business segments with disproportionately high delivery costs

Forecast delivery expense trends for better financial planning

Optimize pricing and logistics strategies based on model-driven insights

Make data-informed decisions to streamline delivery operations and enhance profitability

# Challenges Faced
### Some challenges we encountered included:

Incomplete or inconsistent data entries that required extensive cleaning

Limited historical data for certain product categories, affecting model reliability

Difficulty in aligning technical findings with non-technical business implications

# What I Learned?
### This project deepened my experience in:

Applying machine learning models (ARIMA, XGBoost) to real business problems

Communicating technical insights through compelling visualizations and presentations

Collaborating within a team to drive actionable outcomes

Translating data findings into concrete business recommendations
