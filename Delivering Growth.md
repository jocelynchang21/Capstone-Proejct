## Delivery Cost Optimization â€“ Case Competition Project

### Project Summary & Business Objective

In this competition, our goal was to analyze delivery cost data and uncover actionable insights to support cost optimization and operational efficiency. The business challenge focused on the high variability in delivery expenses across product types, business segments, and volume ranges. The objective was to develop data-driven recommendations to reduce delivery costs while maintaining service levels and ensuring customer satisfaction.

## Group Solution

Our team cleaned and explored the dataset using exploratory data analysis to uncover key patterns, including cost discrepancies across ZIP codes and product categories. We applied ARIMA for time series forecasting and XGBoost for cost prediction. Results were visualized in an interactive ZIP code-level map to support targeted logistics and pricing strategies.

### Key Deliverables:
Cleaned dataset (excluded per data policy)
ARIMA forecasts of delivery trends
XGBoost model for cost prediction
Interactive sales map by ZIP code
Business recommendations for reducing delivery expenses and enhancing operational efficiency

## My Individual Contribution

### As part of this project, I focused on:

- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Addressed incomplete entries, standardized formats, and handled negative or missing values to ensure robust model performance.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Investigated key drivers of delivery cost, identifying ZIP codes and product categories contributing to inefficiencies.

- **Predictive Modeling:** Implemented and validated XGBoost for cost prediction using cross-validation techniques.

- **Interactive Visualization:** Developed an interactive map of sales by ZIP code to support regional decision-making.


- **Business Communication:** Synthesized findings into strategic recommendations and presented results to stakeholders in a clear and impactful format.

## Business Value of the Solution

### Our analysis empowers Swire Coca-Cola stakeholders to:

- **Identify Cost Inefficiencies:** Pinpoint ZIP codes and segments with high delivery costs to target with optimization strategies.

- **Forecast Demand More Accurately:** ARIMA and SVR models improve planning by identifying seasonality and trends.

- **Enhance Operational Planning:** Refine inventory and logistics processes to reduce delivery delays and excess stock.

- **Drive Market Expansion:** Use regional insights from SVR and customer segmentation to identify high-potential markets for growth.

- **Increase Profitability:** Reduce costs through logistics optimization and improve service levels, ultimately enhancing customer satisfaction.

## Challenges Faced

- **Data Quality:** Inconsistent or missing values, particularly in delivered_cases, required intensive preprocessing.

- **Data Sparsity:** Limited historical data for some products and regions reduced modeling confidence.

- **Business Alignment:** Translating technical findings into meaningful business recommendations required iterative refinement and collaboration.

## What I Learned

### This project enhanced my skills in:

- **Machine Learning & Forecasting:** Applied XGBoost and SVR in a real-world logistics setting.

- **Data Storytelling:** Communicated technical insights effectively through visuals and stakeholder presentations.

- **Team Collaboration:** Coordinated with peers across modeling, business, and visualization tasks to deliver a unified solution.

- **Strategic Thinking:** Learned how to align analytics with business objectives for maximum impact.
